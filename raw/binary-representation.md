===

## Problem

Given a (decimal - e.g. 3.72) number that is passed in as a string, return the binary representation that is passed in as a string. If the fractional part of the number can not be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, return ERROR.


## Example

For n = "3.72", return "ERROR".
For n = "3.5", return "11.1".
