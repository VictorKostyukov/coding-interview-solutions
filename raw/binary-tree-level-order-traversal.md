Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
===


Problem
-------

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

Example
-------

Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},

        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7
 

return its level order traversal as:

    [
      [3],
      [9,20],
      [15,7]
    ]

Challenge
---------

Challenge 1: Using only 1 queue to implement it.

Challenge 2: Use DFS algorithm to do it.

Solution
--------
