Expression Tree Build
===

## Problem

The structure of Expression Tree is a binary tree to evaluate certain expressions.
All leaves of the Expression Tree have an number string value. All non-leaves of the Expression Tree have an operator string value.
Now, given an expression array, build the expression tree of this expression, return the root of this expression tree.


## Example

For the expression (2*6-(23+7)/(1+2)) (which can be represented by ["2" "*" "6" "-" "(" "23" "+" "7" ")" "/" "(" "1" "+" "2" ")"]). 
The expression tree will be like
                 [ - ]
             /          \
        [ * ]              [ / ]
      /     \           /         \
    [ 2 ]  [ 6 ]      [ + ]        [ + ]
                     /    \       /      \
                   [ 23 ][ 7 ] [ 1 ]   [ 2 ] .

After building the tree, you just need to return root node [-].
