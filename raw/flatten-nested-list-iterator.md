Flatten Nested List Iterator
===

## Problem

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.
Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

 Notice
You don't need to implement the remove method.



## Example



Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].


Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
