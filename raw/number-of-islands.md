===


Problem
-------

Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands.

Example
-------

Given graph:

    [
      [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
      [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
    ]

return 3.

Note
---------

0 is represented as the sea, 1 is represented as the island. If two 1 is adjacent, we consider them in the same island. We only consider up/down/left/right adjacent.
