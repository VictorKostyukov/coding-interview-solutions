Route Between Two Nodes in Graph
===


Problem
-------

Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

Example
-------

Given graph:

    A----->B----->C
     \     |
      \    |
       \   |
        \  v
         ->D----->E
     
for s = B and t = E, return true

for s = D and t = C, return false
