Subsets
===



Problem
-------

* [LeetCode 78](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

Given a list of numbers that may has duplicate numbers, return all possible subsets

Example
---------

If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:

    [
      [2],
      [1],
      [1,2,2],
      [2,2],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]

Note
----

Each element in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The ordering between two subsets is free.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

Challenge
---------
Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?


Key Point
---------

** Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.**
