## Problem

Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)

 Notice
In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, you should also return a decimal number.



## Example

Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6
return N=(10001010100)2
