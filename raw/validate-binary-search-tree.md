Validate Binary Search Tree
===


Problem
-------

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example
-------

An example:

      2
     / \
    1   4
       / \
      3   5
  
The above binary tree is serialized as {2,1,4,#,#,3,5} (in level order).
