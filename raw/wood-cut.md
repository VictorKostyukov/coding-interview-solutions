Wood Cut
===

## Problem

Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

 Notice
You couldn't cut wood into float length.
If you couldn't get >= k pieces, return 0.



## Example

For L=[232, 124, 456], k=7, return 114.
